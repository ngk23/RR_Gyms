        <h2>Equipments</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <ul>
               <li> 1. Training bench<br>
                A basic but multi-purpose training bench is a must-have in your gym. Definitely suitable for beginners, the training bench is a diverse piece of equipment that serves its purpose for seniors and young athletes as well. It is used for performing weight training exercises or even sit-ups.</li>
                
                2. Dumbbell set<br>
                Also an important necessity for beginners, young athletes, and seniors. The dumbbell set should range from light to heavy in order to accommodate everyone. Dumbbells come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and materials these days, from plastic-coated to colorful to straight-up metal, so take your pick. Get a set with a rack and save time and space, too.<br>
                
                3. Treadmill<br>
                Treadmill is one of the widely popular commercial gym equipment. This equipment offers a great warm-up exercise before you indulge yourself in hardcore, and more muscle and bone-stressing exercise machine. If you just want to shed off some weight and burn extra calories, this gym equipment will do the trick.<br>
                
                4. Stationary Bikes<br>
                This is a good alternative for outdoor biking. Burning your calories and getting an overall workout, you can have it all when you use this commercial gym equipment.  Not only is it safe because you get to exercise indoors, but stationary bikes are relatively easy to operate.<br>
                
                5. Free weights<br>
                Barbells and kettleballs are some of the examples. This commercial gym equipment enables you to do full range of motion exercise while utilizing your upper muscles.<br>
                
                6. Rowing Machines<br>
                This gym equipment enhances your flexibility and versatility. Since it utilizes both the upper (when you glide and pull the machine) and lower (the rower itself) muscles, this commercial gym equipment delivers an overall body workout.<br>
                
                7. Low-impact treadmills<br>

As a gym owner, it is common to know that as you get older normal treadmills, running on concrete and tracks can prove to be hazardous for the knees. Low-impact, pressurized treadmills are designed to spare vulnerable joints, which means they also be a great machine to keep in your gym.<br>
                
                8. Ellipticals<br>
                Considered one of the best commercial gym equipment because of its low-impact features. This means that less stress and tension is distributed to the joints and bones, therefore exercise-related injuries are less likely to occur.<br>
                
                9. Balance trainers and resistance bands<br>
                Although these are not necessarily machines, many beginners, young athletes and seniors enjoy using these accessories in their daily workout. Resistance bands and tubes are simple, inexpensive, portable fitness items for gently building strength, which is great and convenient for seniors. Elastic resistance training is effective for increasing muscle strength in a low-impact way.<br>
                
                Exercise Balls<br>
                Agility ladders<br>
                BOSU balls<br>
                Step benches<br>
                Step cones<br>
